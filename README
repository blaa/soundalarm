Execute event when a presence is detected:
- someone breaks the window
- enters the room
- talks.

Input is filtered to prevent too frequent notifications. Filtering is
configurable using few switches:

    # Number of detections and period of time for detections to matter.
    filter_detections = 4
    filter_time = 6 * 60

    # Gap between notifications
    filter_gap = 10 * 60


    # How many times the amplitude must exceed the background to trigger detection
    filter_level = 7.
    # Number of consecutive detections
    filter_detections = 3

    # After detecting give up for so many sample packs.
    filter_gap = 12


Software is simple and requires no external libraries as it's supposed to run
on open routers (tested on OpenWRT router using USB camera microphone). I had
problems with Python ALSA libraries due to lack of C compiler. 

Running the software takes ~ 3.2% CPU for arecord and 4-6% for detection,
comparing to 20% for motion detection using camera (motion). I enable/disable
it using external flask-based web interface and some scripts.
